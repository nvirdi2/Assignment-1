Reflection:
    In the "a1ms4.c" there was no error because all of the work was in the other files and this file was mostly printing out statements and answers.
  In header file called "contacts.h" there was one error that needed to be fixed and that was the length of the "middleInitial" because it started
  at 0 and which means we need 6 characters. When running it with 5 characters the last name would print out where the middle initials (example:
  N. O.Flint Rubble). When that was changed to 6 it printed out where it was supposed to. The next error was in the "contacts.c" file. On line 31 the
  line was "scanf("%c%*s", &yesNo);" and that needed to be changed to "%c%c" because you are asking for a character and not a string variable. The next
  error in the same file was on line 57 and that was the double quotation marks in the following line: "if (yesNo == "y" || yesNo == "Y")". The reason
  we did not need a double quotation mark is to limit the single letters. This means every time that specific letter is typed the letter is limited to what
  it can do. The last change made was in the same file for line 86 which readout "if (yesNo == 'y' && yesNo == 'Y')". The && needed to be removed and
  replaced with the || because the statement would only work is "y" and "Y" was there but needed it for if any of them are entered. The && works to make
  both conditions are true. The || is used to see if one of the conditions are true than continue. 
    Looking at the files, the contact struct file was very helpful. This made it easier to locate each of the variables to edit rather then looking at 
  one file with a lot of information. The structs were not easy to locate and edit do to this setup but when we called up each struct it is easy to manage
  the data that is inputted because you do not have to find each variable, struct, and input. This is a much more organized way of handling all of the 
  input and keeping it stored. However, in contact.c there are many areas where the code is repeated and there are so many ways to fix that. The first
  change would be declaring the variable "char yesNo;" at the top before the for loops because that made it much easier and less repetitive. This
  would allow the code to just bring up the variable to change to value instead of declaring it as 0 in each for loop. Since these loop conditions are 
  very repetitive because "if (yesNo == 'y' || yesNo == 'Y')" is used in every loop and to change I would do if it does not equal because that would 
  make it less repetitive and it would make it more unique. The "%*c" is repeated so much in the code but the meaning behind it is to ignore one of the
  characters after reading it. This was helpful because we got to read the data and not assign it to a variable. Another very new line was "%[\n]"
  and that was used to read any input the user is giving until the user does not press the enter key. The "%s" only reads and that is not helpful in this case.
